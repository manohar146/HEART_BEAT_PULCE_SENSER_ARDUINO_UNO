# HEART_BEAT_PULCE_SENSER_ARDUINO_UNO
To design a system that detects heartbeats using a PulseSensor, monitors the heart rate over time, and provides real-time feedback on a 16x2 I2C LCD. An LED lights up and a buzzer beeps on each beat for user assurance.
# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Beat Pulse Sensor (Arduino UNO)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a heart beat monitoring system using a pulse sensor and Arduino UNO. It captures pulse signals in real time and provides visual feedback, making it ideal for basic biomedical experimentation and embedded learning.

## Tech Stack
- Arduino UNO (HEART_BET_PULSE_REASER.ino)
- Pulse sensor module (e.g., KY-039 or similar)
- LED or serial monitor for signal visualization
- Excel for pin configuration
- Word documentation for system overview

## Files Included
- `HEART_BET_PULSE_REASER.ino`: Arduino sketch for pulse signal acquisition and processing
- `PULSE_SENSOR_HART_BEAT.docx`: Detailed documentation of system design and operation
- `PIN_OUTS.xlsx`: Pin configuration and hardware mapping
- `Heart_bear_pulce_Sensor_image.jpg`: Photo of the physical setup
- `circuit_image(11).png`: Circuit diagram
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Highlights
- Real-time pulse signal monitoring using embedded sensors
- Modular code structure for easy adaptation to other biomedical modules
- Clear documentation and pin mapping for reproducibility
- Visual assets for hardware setup and circuit layout

## How It Works
- The pulse sensor detects changes in blood flow and sends analog signals to the Arduino
- Arduino processes the signal and displays it via LED blinking or serial output
- Circuit and pin mapping ensure accurate signal flow and safe operation
